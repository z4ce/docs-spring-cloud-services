Release notes for [Spring Cloud Services for Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-spring-cloud-services)

## <a id="1-2-0-migrating-from-1-1-x"></a>Migrating from 1.1.x

For each client application, you must:

* Update the build file to use the new versions of the Spring Cloud Services client dependencies (see [Client Dependencies](/spring-cloud-services/client-dependencies.html))

## <a id="1-2-0-migrating-from-1-0-x"></a>Migrating from 1.0.x

For each client application, you must:

* Update the build file to use the new versions of the Spring Cloud Services client dependencies (see [Client Dependencies](/spring-cloud-services/client-dependencies.html))
* Update the build file to use the Maven BOM dependencies for Spring Boot and Spring Cloud (see [Client Dependencies](/spring-cloud-services/client-dependencies.html))

For each Circuit Breaker Dashboard service instance, you must:

* Upgrade the service instance (see [Service Instance Upgrades](/spring-cloud-services/service-instance-upgrades.html)), then unbind, rebind, and restart each of the service instance's client applications (this is due to a change in how service instance credentials are managed)

* Service Registry service instances can now be configured to replicate service registrations across PCF organization and space boundaries.
* Service Registry service instances now allow multiple applications within a space to register with the same application name, so that registered applications can use a blue / green deployment strategy.
* Service Registry service instance dashboards now display the URI and, if a service instance is operating in high-availability (HA) mode, the local node count of the service instance.
* The Spring Cloud Services broker has been upgraded to Spring Boot 1.3.7 and Spring Cloud Brixton.SR5.
