* General Availability release

Known issues:

* [Feign](https://github.com/Netflix/feign) clients require [Spring Cloud Netflix](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/) version 1.0.4. This release of Spring Cloud Services depends on Spring Cloud Netflix version 1.0.3. If you wish to use a Feign client with a Spring Cloud Services service instance, you must manually override the version of Spring Cloud Netflix used by your application.
<br/> <br/>
    Using Gradle:

    ```groovy
    ext["spring-cloud-netflix.version"] = "1.0.4.RELEASE"
    ```

    Using Maven:

    ```xml
    <properties>
        <!-- override the managed versions of Spring Cloud Netflix dependencies -->
        <spring-cloud-netflix.version>1.0.4.RELEASE</spring-cloud-netflix.version>
    </properties>
    ```
