You can create a Circuit Breaker Dashboard service instance using either the cf Command Line Interface tool or [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) Apps Manager.

## Using the cf CLI

Begin by targeting the correct org and space.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf target -o myorg -s development

API endpoint:   https://api.cf.wise.com (API version: 2.43.0)
User:           user
Org:            myorg
Space:          development
</pre>

If desired, view plan details for the Circuit Breaker Dashboard product using
`cf marketplace -s`.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf marketplace
Getting services from marketplace in org myorg / space development as user...
OK

service                       plans          description
p-circuit-breaker-dashboard   standard       Circuit Breaker Dashboard for Spring Cloud Applications
p-config-server               standard       Config Server for Spring Cloud Applications
p-mysql                       100mb-dev      MySQL service for application development and testing
p-rabbitmq                    standard       RabbitMQ is a robust and scalable high-performance multi-protocol messaging broker.
p-service-registry            standard       Service Registry for Spring Cloud Applications

TIP:  Use 'cf marketplace -s SERVICE' to view descriptions of individual plans of a given service.

$ cf marketplace -s p-circuit-breaker-dashboard
Getting service plan information for service p-circuit-breaker-dashboard as user...
OK

service plan   description     free or paid
standard       Standard Plan   free
</pre>

Run `cf create-service`, specifying the service, plan name, and instance name.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service p-circuit-breaker-dashboard standard circuit-breaker-dashboard
Creating service instance circuit-breaker-dashboard in org myorg / space development as admin...
OK

Create in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service circuit-breaker-dashboard' to check operation status.
</pre>

As the command output suggests, you can use the `cf services` or `cf service` commands to check the status of the service instance. When the service instance is ready, the `cf service` command will give a status of `create succeeded`:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf service circuit-breaker-dashboard

Service instance: circuit-breaker-dashboard
Service: p-circuit-breaker-dashboard

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: You may notice a discrepancy between the status given for a service instance by the cf CLI (e.g., by the <code>cf service</code> command) versus that shown on the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/operator-information.html#service-instances-dashboard">Service Instances dashboard</a>. The dashboard is updated frequently (close to real-time); the status retrieved by the cf CLI is not updated as frequently and may take time to match the dashboard.</p>

## Using Apps Manager

Log into Apps Manager as a Space Developer. In the Marketplace, select **Circuit Breaker**.

   <%= image_tag("circuit-breaker/1_marketplace.png") %>

Select the desired plan for the new service instance.

   <%= image_tag("circuit-breaker/2_select_plan.png") %>

Provide a name for the service instance (for example, "circuit-breaker-dashboard"). Click the **Add** button.

   <%= image_tag("circuit-breaker/3_instance_name.png") %>

In the **Services** list, click the **Manage** link under the listing for the new service instance.

   <%= image_tag("circuit-breaker/4_service_successfully_added.png") %>

It may take a few minutes to provision the service instance; while it is being provisioned, you will see a "The service instance is initializing" message. Once the instance is ready, its dashboard will load automatically.

The Circuit Breaker Dashboard instance is now ready to be used. For an example of using a circuit breaker in an application, see the <a href="/spring-cloud-services/circuit-breaker/writing-client-applications.html">Writing Client Applications</a> topic.
