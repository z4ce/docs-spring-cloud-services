### What Is Spring Cloud Services?

The rise in popularity of cloud-native architectures and the shift to implementing applications as series of focused microservices developed around bounded contexts has led to the discovery and rediscovery of patterns useful in designing distributed systems. Techniques such as service discovery, centralized configuration accessed through an application's deployment environment, and graceful degradation of behavior through circuit breakers are common solutions for this style of architecture and can be built into tools for applying these techniques across applications.

Netflix, a pioneer in the microservices space, has built many such tools. Eureka is a service registry, which registers all of a microservice's instances and supplies each microservice with instance information to use in discovering others. Hystrix, the Hystrix Dashboard, and Turbine provide fault tolerance using circuit breakers and enable monitoring of circuits across microservices and instances. These components have been battle-tested in a production environment facing some of the most demanding traffic requirements in the world, and are available as open-source software.

The [Spring Cloud](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/) family of projects are based on [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) and provide tools including Netflix's Eureka and Hystrix as libraries easily consumable by Spring applications, following idiomatic Spring conventions. [Spring Cloud Netflix](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/) makes the use of Eureka and Hystrix as simple as including starters dependencies in an application and adding an annotation to a configuration class. [Spring Cloud Config](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/) includes a configuration server and client library that enable Spring applications to consume centralized configuration as series of property sources.

Spring Cloud Services <%=vars.scs_suffix%> packages server-side components of Spring Cloud projects, including Spring Cloud Netflix and Spring Cloud Config, and makes them available as services in the PCF Marketplace. This frees you from having to implement and maintain your own managed services in order to use the included projects. You can create a Config Server, Service Registry, or Circuit Breaker Dashboard service instance on-demand, bind to it and consume its functionality, and return to focusing on the value added by your own microservices.

### Services

Spring Cloud Services currently provides the following services.

| Service Type                                                         | Current Version |

| <a href="./config-server/index.html">Config Server</a>               | 10              |
| <a href="./service-registry/index.html">Service Registry</a>         | 10              |
| <a href="./circuit-breaker/index.html">Circuit Breaker Dashboard</a> | 10              |

See below for the Spring Cloud Services releases that include each service version.

| Service Version | Tile Version       |
------------------|--------------------|
| 1               | 1.0.0 - 1.0.3      |

### Service Plans

Spring Cloud Services currently provides the following service plans:

| Plan Name             | Description                                                                         |
------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <code>trial</code>    | Service instances are free and are automatically deleted seven days after creation. |
| <code>standard</code> | Service instances are paid, at $39.99 per month.                                    |

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING: </strong> Service instances created using the <code>trial</code> plan are deleted automatically after seven days. Use this service plan for trial or demonstration purposes only.</p>

#### <code>trial</code> Service Instance Automatic Deletion

Service instances created using the `trial` plan are deleted seven days after creation. You can use this plan to create service instances for trial or demonstration purposes for short-term usage. Do not rely on the `trial` plan for service instances used in production.

## Requirements

Spring Cloud Services for PCF has the following requirements:

* [Java Cloud Foundry buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack) version 4.5 or later (if the default Java buildpack is not at version 4.5 or later, you must specify an alternate buildpack that is at version 4.5 or later when installing Spring Cloud Services; see step 4 of the [Installation](/spring-cloud-services/installation.html) topic)
* A MySQL service (Pivotal recommends [MySQL for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-mysql) or [MySQL for PCF v2](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-mysql) for use with Spring Cloud Services)
* [RabbitMQ for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-rabbitmq-service) (for information about isolating the RabbitMQ cluster used for Spring Cloud Services, see [Running SCS on a Dedicated RabbitMQ Cluster](https://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/replicator.html#scs-isolation) in the RabbitMQ for PCF documentation)
  * If you enable the RabbitMQ&reg; for PCF product's SSL support by providing it with SSL keys and certificates, you must <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/1-11/install-config-pp.html">enable the RabbitMQ for PCF product's TLS 1.0 support</a>
* A single Pivotal Application Service (PAS) or Elastic Runtime SSL certificate (see the Pivotal Cloud Foundry documentation for information about <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/security_config.html">configuring the SSL certificate</a>) that includes the following domains, where `SYS_DOMAIN.TLD` is your PCF installation's system domain and `APP_DOMAIN.TLD` is your PCF installation's application domain:
  * `*.SYS_DOMAIN.TLD`
  * `*.APP_DOMAIN.TLD`
  * `*.login.SYS_DOMAIN.TLD`
  * `*.uaa.SYS_DOMAIN.TLD`
<% end %>
