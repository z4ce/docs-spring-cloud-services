## Overview

The Spring Cloud Services plugin for the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface tool (cf CLI) adds commands for interacting with Spring Cloud Services service instances. It provides easy access to functionality relating to the Config Server and Service Registry; for example, it can be used to send values to a Config Server service instance for encryption or to list all applications registered with a Service Registry service instance.

The Spring Cloud Services cf CLI plugin is open-source software released under the [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) license. From the plugin's [homepage on GitHub](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/spring-cloud-services-cli-plugin), you can raise issues or submit contributions for consideration by the plugin's authors.
