To connect client applications to the Service Registry, Spring Cloud Services uses [Spring Cloud Connectors](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/spring-cloud-connectors.html), including the [Spring Cloud Cloud Foundry Connector](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/spring-cloud-cloud-foundry-connector.html), which discovers services bound to applications running in Cloud Foundry.

## <a id="service-detection"></a>Service Detection

The connector inspects Cloud Foundry's `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable, which stores connection and identification information for service instances that are bound to Cloud Foundry applications, to detect available services. Below is an example of a `VCAP_SERVICES` entry for the Spring Cloud Services Service Registry.

```json
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "p-service-registry": [
   {
    "credentials": {
     "access_token_uri": "https://p-spring-cloud-services.uaa.cf.wise.com/oauth/token",
     "client_id": "p-service-registry-57bdc399-5b2e-4131-b941-d0a4275c2da4",
     "client_secret": "GAmFDRU4KGnS",
     "uri": "https://eureka-32fb7386-2d57-4054-91b4-9fd4dcbac221.apps.wise.com"
    },
    "label": "p-service-registry",
    "name": "service-registry",
    "plan": "standard",
    "tags": [
     "eureka",
     "discovery",
     "registry",
     "spring-cloud"
    ]
   }
  ]
```

For each service in the `VCAP_SERVICES` variable, the connector considers the following fields:

* `tags`: Attributes or names of backing technologies behind the service.
* `label`: The service offering's name (not to be confused with a service _instance's_ name).
* `credentials.uri`: A URI pertaining to the service instance.
* `credentials.uris`: URIs pertaining to the service instance.

### <a id="service-registry-detection-criteria"></a>Service Registry Detection Criteria

To establish availability of the Service Registry, the Spring Cloud Cloud Foundry Connector compares `VCAP_SERVICES` service entries against the following criteria:

* `tags` including `eureka`

## <a id="application-configuration"></a>Application Configuration

In a Spring Boot application which is bound to a Service Registry service instance, the connector automatically configures a Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka client configuration bean. The client configuration includes the discovery zone, which is configured using the URL from the service binding; this is equivalent to setting the ```eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone``` property.

### <a id="eureka-application-name-configuration"></a>Eureka Application Name Configuration

A client application registers with the Spring Cloud Services Service Registry using an _application name_. This value is used by Netflix Eureka to look up instances of an application and to set Eureka's _virtual hostname_ and _secure virtual hostname_ for the application. In an application that registers with a Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka server, the Eureka application name is by default the value of the application's `spring.application.name` property. If the value of the application's `spring.application.name` property is used for the Eureka application name and contains one or more characters which are invalid in a hostname, the Spring Cloud Services connector for Service Registry sanitizes that value by using a hyphen (`-`) to replace each invalid character.

You can register a client application with the Service Registry using an application name that differs from `spring.application.name`. To do so, you must set the `eureka.instance.appname` property. If set, this value will be used verbatim for the application's Eureka application name, virtual hostname, and secure virtual hostname; it therefore must contain only characters which are valid in a hostname.

Examples of values provided for the `eureka.instance.appname` property, values provided for the `spring.application.name` property, and the Eureka application names resulting from combinations of these values or from providing a given value for `spring.application.name` but none for `eureka.instance.appname` are listed below.

| <code>eureka.instance.appname</code> | <code>spring.application.name</code>  | Resultant application name |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| vhn                                   | san                                  | vhn                        |
| v_hn                                  | san                                  | v_hn                       |
| <em>(not provided)</em>               | san                                  | san                        |
| <em>(not provided)</em>               | s_an                                 | s-an                       |
| x_y                                   | x_y                                  | x_y                        |

#### Application Name Property Restrictions

To identify instances of an application, Netflix Eureka uses three `eureka.instance` properties: `appname`, `virtualHostName`, and `secureVirtualHostName`. For consistency with Spring Cloud features such as [Spring Cloud Netflix Zuul](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/Camden.SR3/#_router_and_filter_zuul)</a>'s automatic routing to registered applications and the [load-balanced `RestTemplate`](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/Camden.SR3/#_spring_resttemplate_as_a_load_balancer_client) using [Spring Cloud Netflix Ribbon](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/Camden.SR3/#spring-cloud-ribbon), and to secure ownership of Eureka application names, the Spring Cloud Services Service Registry rejects a registration that includes different non-null values for any of these three properties.

If you set only the `spring.application.name` property or the `eureka.instance.appname` property, the Spring Cloud Services connector will set the `eureka.instance.virtualHostName` and `eureka.instance.secureVirtualHostname` properties to the same value. If you explicitly set different values for `eureka.instance.appname`, `eureka.instance.virtualHostName`, and `eureka.instance.secureVirtualHostName`, the Spring Cloud Services connector will prevent the application from starting, and you will see an error message in the application logs:

```
eureka.instance.virtualHostName 'foo' is set to a different value than
eureka.instance.appname 'bar', and is disallowed in Spring Cloud Services.
Try only setting eureka.instance.appname. Please refer to our documentation
and reach out to us if you think you require different values.
```
